# FFF aka stuFF Finder

A simple Bash script that automatically search stuff on the desired websites, by opening tabs in the default browser.

I use it to search for books and as I'm currently based in Germany the script redirect to German sites.
The sites are there as examples and you can modify the script to point to other websites, specify categories, sort your search and so on.

This script looks for:
- Ebay.de - filtering items from lowest price
- Ebay.de - only auctions filtering items from ending soonest
- ebay-kleinazeigen.de - default filter
- medimops.de - filtering items from lowest price
- rebuy.de - filtering items from lowest price
