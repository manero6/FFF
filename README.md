# FFF aka stuFF Finder

A simple script that automatically search stuff on the desired websites and open tabs on the browser.

I use it mainly to search for books and as I'm currently based in Germany the script redirect to german sites.
The sites are there as examples and you can modify the script to point to other websites, specify categories, filters and so on.

This script searches:
- Ebay.de - filtering items from lowest price
- Ebay.de - only autions filtering items from ending soonest
- ebay-kleinazeigen.de - default filter
- medimops.de - filtering items from lowest price
- rebuy.de - filtering items from lowest price
