# FFF aka stuFF Finder

A Bash script that automatically search stuff on the desired websites, by opening new tabs in the default browser.

I used it initially to search for books on some websites.
The script evolved and it can search on different categories, each with their own websites.

In this repository there are some default configuration files. These are downloaded by FFF in case it finds no configuration file locally.
Each configuration files contains different websites and will appear in FFF as a search category.

The configuration files are there as examples and you can modify them to point to other websites, sort your search and so on.

The default configuration files look for:
- Ebay-DE - Ebay like websites in Germany
- Videos - mainstream video platforms like YT and Vimeo
- Videos-Alt - less-known/alternative video platform like Odysee, Bitchute and Internet Archive
